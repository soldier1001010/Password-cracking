# Password-cracking
To hack the password of a site we will use hydra,
hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login
password "hacking" tool.
Hydra will search inside a wordlist file (recommended rockyou.txt, it contains
millions and millions of common passwords, if you use kali linux it is already
installed, otherwise you can go and look for it online) until it finds the right
password, which will be written in the terminal at the end of the operation.
